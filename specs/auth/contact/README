Introduction:
This web Service takes the contact form data submitted by the user and 
returns an appropriate reply.
On success this then sends a "noreply" type of system generated message to 
the user as an acknowledgment and sends a copy of the user's submission 
to our glygen mail ID.

Web Service call:
HTTP Request method:    POST
Variable:               name        First name of the user
                        surname     Last name of the user
                        subject     Subject selected from dropdown
                        email       email ID of the user
                        message     The textual feedback from the user.

Function:
The web service on receiving a call will process it and returns
"alert-success" on successful submission or "alert-danger" on some
processing error. It also returns a message describing it further. 
The result set will be encoded in JSON (see separate JSON schema) and returned.

The Web service should send: 
1. an acknowledgment mail to the email specified in the [request].
2. a mail containing the [request] info to our glygen mail ID.

Response:
Content:                        JSON{type, message}
HTTP Content type:              application/JSON
Access-Control-Allow-Origin:    *

Warning
To all Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) the web service has to allow all domains access. Otherwise browsers will not permit to call this web service by a webpage. Therefore the HTTP response header must contain the appropriate Access-Control-Allow-Origin statement.

Note
An example JSON is available separately and the JSON data structure is documented in a JSON schema.
