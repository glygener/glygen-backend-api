Introduction:
This web service is used to assign unique IDs to user/browsers. This IDs will be used in combination for the logging WS for user tracking, error reporting and usage statistic.

Web service call:
HTTP Request method		GET
Variables			none

Function:
For each request the WS returns a unique (so far unused) ID. The server needs to store all previously assigned IDs and compare with this list. Simple timestamp is not sufficient to guaranty a unique ID. After an ID has not been used for a certain time it might be reassigned. The result set will be encoded in JSON (see separate JSON schema) and returned. 

Response
Content					JSON
HTTP Content Type			application/json
Access-Control-Allow-Origin		*

Warning:
To all Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) the web service has to allow all domains access. Otherwise browsers will not permit to call this web service by a webpage. Therefore the HTTP response header must contain the appropriate Access-Control-Allow-Origin statement.

Note:
An example JSON is available separately and the JSON data structure is documented in a JSON schema.
