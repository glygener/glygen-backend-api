Introduction:
=============
This webform is used to initialize the search fields of the Protein search webpage:
-	Mass fields
-   Species



Search Workflow:
================
User enters search criteria on the search page.
1.JavaScript generates a JSON search query calls search WS.
2.Search WS returns the result list ID
3.Result list ID is passed to the list page
4.Result list ID is passed to list WS together with information about sorting and number of requested results
5.List WS returns requested number of results.

Note:
=====
When performing a search the server has to assign a unique ID to each search result and store the search result and ID. 
This will also allow us to persist search results even across database changes.

Web service call: 
=================

Warning:
========
To all Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) the web service has to allow all domains access. Otherwise browsers will not permit to call this web service by a webpage. 
Therefore the HTTP response header must contain the appropriate Access-Control-Allow-Origin statement.
