Publication Status: Online-Only, [RefSeq]; There was correlation between turbidity toxin intrinsic syndrome of Chronic Erosive Gastritis patients and the expression level of HGF and c-Met., [RefSeq]; Potent mitogen for mature parenchymal hepatocyte cells, seems to be a hepatotrophic factor, and acts as a growth factor for a broad spectrum of tissues and cell types. Activating ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase MET by binding to it and promoting its dimerization., [UniProtKB]; MM-131, a bispecific anti-Met/EpCAM mAb, inhibits HGF-dependent and HGF-independent Met signaling through concurrent binding to EpCAM., [RefSeq]; Human albumin-expressing ASC-C were observed in the livers of recipient animals. High levels of expression of HGF and its downstream signaling molecules, including p-38, were detected in the ASC-C-injected livers., [RefSeq]",
